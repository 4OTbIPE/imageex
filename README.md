# ImageEx - Extended Image Control for UWP and WinUI apps
The ImageEx control extends the standard image platform control, improving the performance and responsiveness of your applications.
The source images are loaded asynchronously, and a loading indicator is displayed during execution.
After downloading, the original image is saved in the local cache of the application to save resources and loading time the next time the image is displayed.

This package contains a separate ImageEx control from the Windows Community Toolkit 7.x package.
Since this control was removed in Toolkit version 8.0, this package was created containing only this control and having no dependencies.
