ImageEx - Extended Image Control for UWP and WinUI apps

This package contains a separate ImageEx control from the Windows Community Toolkit 7.x package. 
Since this control was removed in the 8.0 version of the toolkit, this package was created, which contains only this control and has no dependencies.
